# gatsby-source-meetup

Source plugin for pulling [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) data about a specific Group and the events associated to it.

## Install

`npm install --save gatsby-source-meetup`

## How to use

First, you need a way to pass environment variables to the build process, so secrets and other secured data aren't committed to source control. We recommend using [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) which will then expose environment variables. [Read more about dotenv and using environment variables here](envvars). Then we can _use_ these environment variables and configure our plugin.

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-meetup`,
      options: {
        // Learn about environment variables: https://gatsby.app/env-vars
        // Your Meetup.com API key can be retrieved here: https://secure.meetup.com/fr-FR/meetup_api/key/
        apiKey: process.env.MEETUP_API_KEY,
        // Mandatory: the URL name of a Meetup Group.
        // See the URL of the group page, e.g. https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/jamstack-paris
        groupUrlName: "jamstack-paris",
        // Optional parameters for retrieving Events, see full documentation at
        // https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/:urlname/events/?uri=%2Fmeetup_api%2Fdocs%2F%3Aurlname%2Fevents%2F#list
        status: "upcoming,past",
        desc: "true",
        page: 10
      },
    },
  ],
}
```


### Querying multiple groups

To get data from multiple Groups, you can define the plugin multiple times:

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-meetup`,
      options: {
        apiKey: process.env.MEETUP_API_KEY,
        groupUrlName: "jamstack-paris",
        status: "past",
        desc: "true",
        page: 10
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-meetup`,
      options: {
        apiKey: process.env.MEETUP_API_KEY,
        groupUrlName: "paris-js",
        status: "upcoming,past",
        desc: "true",
        page: 10
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

### Querying events with multiple options

To get data from the same Group with multiple options (sorting, number of eventsâ€¦) depending on their status, you can use the optional parameter `eventsOptions`:

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-meetup`,
      options: {
        apiKey: process.env.MEETUP_API_KEY,
        groupUrlName: "jamstack-paris",
        status: "past",
        desc: "true",
        page: 10,
        eventsOptions: [
          {
            status: `upcoming`,
            desc: `true`,
            page: 1,
          },
          {
            status: `past`,
            desc: `true`,
            page: 5,
          }
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

With eventsOptions used above, you get the first next event from today and the last 5 events.

## How to query

```graphql
{
